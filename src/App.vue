        <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste</li>

      <p>Instructions</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
        You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat the pan: </strong> Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the omelette:</strong> Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
        the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Add fillings (optional):</strong> When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
        middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold and serve:</strong> As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
        fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
      </ol>
